Hello! I'm a Fulbright scholar and a graduate student currently pursuing my master's degree in **Computational Social Science** at the **University of California, San Diego**. I have a bachelors in **Computer Science** with a minor in **Mathematics** from **Habib University, Pakistan**.

My interests include studying dynamically evolving human social networks using **agent-based modeling**, **game theory** and **computational simulations**.

Hello! I'm a Fulbright Alumnus with a Master's degree in **Computational Social Science** from the **University of California, San Diego**. I have a Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science** with a minor in **Mathematics** from **Habib University, Pakistan**.

My academic and research interests are focused on dynamically evolving human social networks, which I study using **agent-based modeling**, **game theory** and **computational simulations**.

I am currently working as a **Dean's Fellow** in the Computer Science department at my alma mater, **Habib University**.

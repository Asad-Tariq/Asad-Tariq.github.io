This course explores in detail the theoretical and practical aspects of Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). It aims to build an understanding of database modeling, relational algebra, structured query language (SQL), transaction management, and concurrency control. Additionally, the course covers topics related to database connectivity with front-end applications and discusses administrative aspects of database systems. These aspects include database security, the distinction between database management, data warehousing, and data mining, as well as big data and its challenges. Modern database techniques are also a part of the course, including a discussion of MongoDB as one of the modern databases.

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) offers a new and powerful way to cope with complexity. Instead of viewing a program as a series of steps to be carried out, it views it as a group of objects that have certain properties and can take certain action. This course aims to introduce fundamental OOP concepts, and use C++ as an object oriented programming language. Students will design and develop a project applying all the concepts learned in the course. On successful completion of the course, the students are expected to have learned how complex projects are designed and developed using OOP approach.
